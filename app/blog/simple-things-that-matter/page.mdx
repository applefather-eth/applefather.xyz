# Simple Things That Matter

## The Goals:

- **For the body** – Active
- **For the mind** – Calm
- **For the emotions** – Stable
- **For the brain** – Clear

## Routine:

- Move in the early morning to awaken the body.
- Sleeping late is harmful; it drains energy the next day.
- Sleep debt is a debt you'll always have to pay — best not to owe.
- No coffee after 5PM or you'll struggle to sleep.
- Evenings are for winding down, mornings are for high energy — don't swap them.
- Overeating slows down the body.
- When sleepy, go to sleep immediately — avoid instant distractions.
- Exercise daily, don't skip.
- Sleep early for a full and restful night.
- You don't need to eat breakfast before working.
- Deep breathing recharges the body; deep thinking recharges the mind.

## Time Spent:

- Manage your energy, not just your time. Save it for what's important; avoid wasting it on quick pleasures.
- Don't spend time with people who lower your quality of life.
- Focus on actions with a compound effect. Avoid short-term dopamine hits.

## Think Long-Term:

- What feels urgent now often fades — don't lose calm over it.
- True success takes hard work; there are few shortcuts.
- Know what you want and invest time in it — you'll make it.
- Unnecessary things help us recognize what truly matters. Wrong decisions help reveal the right ones.
- It's important to have a personal ideal and strategy. What's yours?

## Action:

- When feeling foggy or distracted, write out your thoughts and plans.
- Time with your child is precious — cherish it more.
- Avoid places that make you feel uncomfortable.
- Have financial backups — it brings peace of mind.
- Be kind to those around you, and they'll reflect it back.
- "Illness enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of it."
- If you feel stuck, maybe you just need rest — not to quit.
- When your mood is off, avoid hurting others — reset yourself first.
