# Simple Things That Matter

## The Goals:

- **For the body** – Active
- **For the mind** – Calm
- **For the emotions** – Stable
- **For the brain** – Clear

## Routine:

- **Sweat as soon as you wake up to awaken the body**

  We need to sweat to complete the detoxification process from yesterday and warm up for the new day. Then take a refreshing shower to feel clean and energized.

- **You don't need to eat breakfast before working.**

  Since primitive times, we haven't had food readily available upon waking. We needed to hunt and gather to obtain food, and this principle still holds true today. Our brains are still programmed for this pattern, and it functions most actively during the period between waking up and having our first meal.

- **Exercise daily, don't skip.**

  The human body is an incredibly complex machine that requires regular maintenance, and exercise is the most effective way to maintain it.

- **Overeating slows down the body.**

  Our bodies don't need as much as we think. We live in an era of food abundance, but our bodies are still designed for scarcity. Stop eating before you feel full, eat before you feel hungry, and take your time while eating. This gives your brain enough time to process the signals from your stomach, as there's always a delay in this communication.

- **Get sunlight, breathing breeze, walk barefoot on the ground.**

  The simplest way to receive energy from the outside world. Vitamin D, fresh air, and free electrons from the earth's surface.

- **A nap can turn your day into 48 hours.**

  Our brain divides a day by waking up and going to sleep. By giving it a break in between, you can easily get the mental clarity and energy of two days - that's a good trade.

- **No caffein after 5PM or you'll struggle to sleep.**

  The half-life of caffeine is half a day, meaning you'll still have caffeine in your system even when your body is tired. By the time you realize you need rest, it's already too late.

- **Evenings are for winding down, mornings are for high energy — don't swap them.**

  We cannot maintain focus 24 hours a day. The most effective way to increase focus when we need to work is to rest properly when we should rest. Don't feel guilty about taking rest time - it's a worthwhile investment.

- **Avoid eating late at night**

  Dinner should end at least 4 hours before bedtime. Don't overload your stomach - it's unnecessary. Eating too much and too close to bedtime will reduce sleep quality, overwork your internal organs at night, and leave you waking up with a heavy body.

## Sleep:

- When sleepy, go to sleep immediately — avoid instant distractions.
- Sleeping late is harmful; it drains energy the next day.
- Sleep debt is a debt you'll always have to pay — best not to owe.
- Sleep early for a full and restful night.

## Time Spent:

- Manage your energy, not just your time. Save it for what's important; avoid wasting it on quick pleasures.
- Don't spend time with people who lower your quality of life.
- Focus on actions with a compound effect. Avoid short-term dopamine hits.

---

## Think Long-Term:

- What feels urgent now often fades — don't lose calm over it.
- True success takes hard work; there are few shortcuts.
- Know what you want and invest time in it — you'll make it.
- It's important to have a personal ideal and strategy. What's yours?

---

## Action:

- When feeling foggy or distracted, write out your thoughts and plans.
- Time with your child is precious — cherish it more.
- Avoid places that make you feel uncomfortable.
- Have financial backups — it brings peace of mind.
- Be kind to those around you, and they'll reflect it back.
- "Illness enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of it."
- If you feel stuck, maybe you just need rest — not to quit.
- When your mood is off, avoid hurting others — reset yourself first.
- Deep breathing recharges the body; deep thinking recharges the mind.
- Unnecessary things help us recognize what truly matters. Wrong decisions help reveal the right ones.
