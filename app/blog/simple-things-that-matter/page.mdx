## Routine:

- Exercise daily, don't skip.
- Overeating slows down the body.
- A nap can turn your day into 48 hours.
- No caffein after 5PM or you'll struggle to sleep.
- Evenings are for winding down, mornings are for high energy, don't swap.

## Sleep:

- When sleepy, go to sleep immediately, avoid instant distractions.
- Sleeping late is harmful, it drains energy the next day.
- Sleep debt is a debt you'll always have to pay, best not to owe.
- Sleep early for a full and restful night.

## Time Spent:

- Manage your energy, not just your time. Save it for what's important; avoid wasting it on quick pleasures.
- Don't spend time with people who lower your quality of life.
- Focus on actions with a compound effect. Avoid short-term dopamine hits.
